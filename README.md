Was done quite early with this one and couldn't think of things to add to enhance it.

So instead I'm calling it done and started working on another project.

The plan was if I got it done in time I would send the new one in instead but due to some slow days and javascript animations not cooperating with me it's not quite ready for presentation.

Will keep working on it though as the ideas I had for it is quite cool. 

Will send a link to it when I finnish (or get stuck) ;)
